# ✅ Settings & Username Search Implementation

## 🎯 What Was Fixed & Implemented

### 1. ✅ **Username Search Fixed (SQLite Compatible)**
**Problem:** The search was using PostgreSQL-specific features (`mode: 'insensitive'`) that don't work with SQLite.

**Solution:** 
- Updated `userController.js` to fetch all tenants and filter in JavaScript for case-insensitive search
- Now works perfectly with SQLite database
- Supports partial username matching (e.g., "test" finds "testuser123")

**Files Modified:**
- `rentease-backend/src/controllers/userController.js`

### 2. ✅ **Profile Settings Page Created**
**Features:**
- Update username, name, and email
- Change password securely
- Beautiful, modern UI matching Financr theme
- Real-time validation
- Success/error alerts

**Files Created:**
- `frontend/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`
- `rentease-backend/src/routes/profileRoutes.js`
- `rentease-backend/src/controllers/profileController.js`

**Files Modified:**
- `rentease-backend/src/server.js` (added profile routes)
- `frontend/components/Sidebar.tsx` (added Settings button)

### 3. ✅ **Rent Plan Creation Working**
**Features:**
- Landlords can search tenants by username with live validation
- Dropdown for lease duration (3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36 months)
- Username validation shows error if tenant doesn't exist
- Form validation before submission
- Success feedback after plan creation

**Files Modified:**
- `frontend/components/CreateRentPlanModal.tsx`
